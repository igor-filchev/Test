<spoiler>
The cake is a lie.
</spoiler>

his is a sentence >!with a spoiler in it.!<
Which would output:

This is a sentence <span class="spoiler">with a spoiler in it.</span>
Though, I wonder if it would make a line that starts with an inline spoiler trickier to to write a parse for, like:

>!Spoiler at the beginning!< of this sentence
may render like:

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p>Spoiler at the beginning!< of this sentence</p>
</blockquote>

>! Spoiler text!
