To activate my file upload module you need to do next steps:
1) Add to your project FileAPI files (In Panel Project file_upload directory in js one)
2) Add file_upload directory from path: /template/modules and activate main file
3) {Set up directory for file upload in ajax.php and enable code for attaching to the database name of uploaded files}

>! My module uses [FileAPI](https://github.com/RubaXa/jquery.fileapi jquery plugin/) !

[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
[comment]: <> (in  the output file unless you use it in)
[comment]: <> (a reference style link.)
Or you could go further:

[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)
To improve platform compatibility (and to save one keystroke) it is also possible to use # (which is a legitimate hyperlink target) instead of <>:

[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
