To activate my file upload module you need to do next steps:
1) Add to your project FileAPI files (In Panel Project file_upload directory in js one)
2) Add file_upload directory from path: /template/modules and activate main file
3) {Set up directory for file upload in ajax.php and enable code for attaching to the database name of uploaded files}

/My module uses [FileAPI]:https://github.com/RubaXa/jquery.fileapi jquery plugin/
